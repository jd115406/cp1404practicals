# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I usually would only be a bit slower than I expected, althought it would vary depending on the task.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Definitely got better as my skills started to develop I could sus out what the task actually wanted and could more easily
break the tasks into those of which I knew I could handle.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Really helped to develop my developmental process, taking the time to stop and envision the task is often more effective than 
mindlessly throwing errors.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt that we are creating a programming that doesn't just make sense to you but to other developers as well. As such I took
much more precarious steps in making sure I am laying tasks out as effectively as possible for another person to follow and
continue working.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I really enjoy gaining other people's perspectives on how to approach tasks. It's really interesting the number of ways a 
task can be completed. Moreover, it is highly beneficial for other coders to review your work, many brains are stronger than one.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 6 Review](https://github.com/JDMjcu/CP1404practicals/pull/2/files)

### Explanation

In this review, I gave positive feedback in specific instances where I knew that they were specific requirements for this subject. These 
included error-checking, string formatting, naming and code formatting.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 9 Review](https://github.com/DanielNorman47/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

In this review, I took time to consider correct error-checking, formatting and made sure to ask questions based on what the outcome of the code will
be. I wanted to make sure that they knew when they were doing stuff write so I made sure to compliment on these instances.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I really like being stepped out initially, and then letting the reigns free. If I were in charge and wanted to appeal 
to my learning style I would create a little video for each practical task (obviously time consuming) but I feel like
it would be nice going through the journey with the lecturer.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

This is my first online class, and because of that I did this subject mostly by myself. I am very proud that I was able to 
continue to stay intrinsically motivated and complete the practicals and assignements that I know where to the best of my own 
ability.
